The logon type indicates how the user logged on:

2: Interactive (physical logon)
3: Network
4: Batch (scheduled task executed under this user)
5: Service (service runs under this user)
7: Unlock (workstation/server was unlocked)
8: NetworkClearText (usually used with IIS)
9: NewCredentials (allows cloning of token)
10: RemoteInteractive (RDP, terminal services, remote assistance logons)
11: CachedInteractive (logons when domain is unavailable, e.g. from laptops)
12: CachedRemoteInteractive
13: CachedUnlock

The "Source Network Address" shows the IP address from which the logon originated, usually 127.0.0.1 when the logon was a logon type 2. For remote desktop sessions, this will show the IP address of the remote host from which the RDP connection is coming.
